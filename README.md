R'budget is a budgeting app designed with a simple user interface but yet built in with similar features as a banking app. Once a new user signs up they will be directed to their homepage which displays $0. The user can deposit money to the money tracker and withdraw any sum of money for different expenses. The app records each deposit and withdraw along with their categories and descriptions and will display a log under 'statements' of the recent month's transaction history. The user can visually see their expenses for different categories in a pie chart and bar chart under 'visuals'. There is a feature that recommends certain percentages for spending for each category. When the user withdraws past that percentage, they will get a warning, they can also see a visual pie chart of their recommended percentages and compare it to their own pie chart. If they do not like the current percentages, there is a feature for the user to set their own recommendations. If the app's user wants to save up for something there is a 'goals' page. Inside of the goals page they can set a dollar amount and a percentage of their savings they would like to go to this goal. If they have saved up enough for, letâ€™s say a summer vacation, then the page will notify the user that they have reached their goal and will provide a button to reset the goal once the item is purchased.

This app was built using Firestore for the database, HTML5 and CSS for the website, JavaScript for all scripting functions and is hosted by GitHub pages and go daddy.

Features in the future: 
1. An option to view statements from different months out of the year for different years.
2. Improve the response time from the database for new non-cached visits. 
3. Fix functionality in 'contact' page - currently not working.
